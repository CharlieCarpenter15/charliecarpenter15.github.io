   git push origin main
   ```

## Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

### Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

2. **Connect your GitHub repository:**
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
   - Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
   - Select your `charliecarpenter15.github.io` repository

3. **Configure build settings:**

### Option B: Drag and Drop

1. **Create a zip file** of your project (excluding `.git` folder)
2. **Drag and drop** the zip file to the Netlify dashboard
3. **Your site will be deployed immediately**

## Step 3: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **In your Netlify dashboard:**
   - Go to "Site settings" â†’ "Domain management"
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter your domain name (e.g., `charliecarpenter.com`)

2. **Update DNS settings:**
   - Add a CNAME record pointing to your Netlify URL
   - Or use Netlify DNS for easier management

## Step 4: Set Up Contact Form Notifications

1. **Configure form notifications:**

   - Click "Form notifications"
   - Add email notification to `me@charliecarpenter.com`

## Step 5: Enable Form Spam Protection

1. **Netlify automatically includes:**

2. **To enable reCAPTCHA:**
   - Go to "Site settings" â†’ "Forms"
   - Enable "reCAPTCHA 2"
   - Get keys from Google reCAPTCHA console

## Step 6: Set Up Continuous Deployment

**Your site will automatically redeploy when you push to GitHub!**

1. **Make changes locally**
2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update portfolio content"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Netlify automatically rebuilds and deploys**

## Form Submission Workflow

When someone submits your contact form:

1. **Form data is captured** by Netlify
2. **User is redirected** to `thank-you.html`
3. **You receive email notification** with form details
4. **Form data is stored** in Netlify dashboard (Site settings â†’ Forms)

## Environment Variables (If Needed)

For future API integrations:

1. **Go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables**
2. **Add variables like:**
   - `EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
   - `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`

## Monitoring and Analytics

   - Add GA4 tracking code to your HTML
   - Monitor visitor behavior

## Custom Error Pages

## Security Features Enabled

- **HTTPS by default** (Let's Encrypt SSL)
- **Security headers** (XSS protection, content sniffing protection)

- **Asset optimization** and caching

## Useful Netlify Features

1. **Deploy previews:** Every pull request gets a preview URL
2. **Branch deploys:** Deploy different branches for testing
3. **Functions:** Add serverless functions for advanced features
4. **Edge handlers:** Modify requests/responses at the edge

## Troubleshooting

### Form Not Working
- Check form has `data-netlify="true"`
- Ensure `name` attribute on form element
- Verify hidden `form-name` input field

### Site Not Updating
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Verify GitHub webhook is active
- Clear cache and hard refresh

### Custom Domain Issues
- Check DNS propagation (can take 24-48 hours)
- Verify CNAME/A records are correct
- Enable "Force HTTPS" in domain settings
